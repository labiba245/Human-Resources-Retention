# Project Description
In this project, I have used Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier and Deep Learning to predict if an employee will leave or not. Random Forest Classifier performed the best with an accuracy of 99.13%. 

Satisfaction level of employees is the most important factor in determining if an employee will leave or not followed by the number of projects an employee has been involved in and the number of years spent in the company. 

This analysis can be used to retain employees, who are deemed vital for the company's success, by giving them added benefits such as a pay raise.
